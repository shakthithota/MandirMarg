<h4> BASARA </h4>

Searching for a peaceful abode, they then moved into the Dandakaranya forest and finally chose this place owing to peaceful climate. Maharishi Vyasa was known for performing his regular ablutions in the Godavari river. Each day after this process he used to get sand in fists and made them into images of Goddess Saraswathi, Lakshmi and Kali by means of his mystic power and offered prayers. The place derives its name from Vyasa and called Vasar or Basar (Basara in local dialect). </p>

<h4> JAGANNATH TEMPLE </h4>
<p> This temple is a replica of the original Jagannath Temple of Puri. However, this temple is much smaller and its design resembles the one in Puri, Orissa. The Hyderabad version of Puri’s temple was built on 3000-square yard area. It is located adjacent to the Telangana Bhavan in the posh suburbs of Banjara Hills. This temple is so captivating that it is tagged as one of the must-visit places of Hyderabad. The most appealing portion of the temple is its “Shikaram” (the peak or the top). It is about 70 feet in height. Sand stones brought from Orissa have been used in the construction of this temple, and that justifies its red colour and around 60 sculptors were employed to carve this awe-inspiring temple. </p>
